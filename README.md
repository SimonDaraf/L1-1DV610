# L1-1DV610
The source files for L1-1DV610 - The Terminal Editor (WIP)

## Branching Strategy
For this project I've decided to start lightly. I will only be working in the main branch.

## Concept
The concept is a small code editor. That supports some very simple syntax. The editor will allow users to initialize variables such as integers and strings.
Perform simple operations on integers such as add and subtract. As well as feature a print command to print to the console.
